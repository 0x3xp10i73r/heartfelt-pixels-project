              My Dearest,
            </p>
            
            <p className="mb-6 leading-relaxed text-lg">
              I've been thinking about what happened, and I can't stop replaying it in my mind. 
              I know I hurt you, and that's the last thing I ever wanted to do. You deserve so much better than my thoughtless words and actions.
            </p>

            <p className="mb-6 leading-relaxed text-lg">
              What we have is precious to me â€“ more precious than I've ever been able to express. 
              You bring light into my world in ways you probably don't even realize. Your laugh, 
              your kindness, the way you see the good in everything... you make me want to be better.
            </p>

            <p className="mb-6 leading-relaxed text-lg">
              I know saying "I'm sorry" isn't enough to undo the hurt, but please know that it comes 
              from the deepest part of my heart. I'm committed to learning from this, to listening better, 
              and to being the partner you deserve.
            </p>

            <p className="text-xl text-center font-medium text-primary mt-8">
              I love you more than words can say, and I hope you'll give me the chance to show you that every day moving forward.
            </p>

            <p className="text-center mt-8 text-lg italic text-muted-foreground">
              Forever yours,<br />
